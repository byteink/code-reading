[[rn_1.5.0_upgrade_notes]]
== Upgrade Notes

* Kudu 1.5 now enables the optional ability to compute, store, and verify
  checksums on all pieces of data stored on a server by default. Due to
  storage format changes, downgrading to versions 1.3 or earlier is not
  supported and will result in an error.

* Spark 2.2+ requires Java 8 at runtime even though Kudu Spark 2.x integration
  is Java 7 compatible. Spark 2.2 is the default dependency version as of
  Kudu 1.5.0.

* The kudu-spark-tools module has been renamed to kudu-spark2-tools_2.11 in
  order to include the Spark and Scala base versions. This matches the pattern
  used in the kudu-spark module and artifacts.

* To improve security, world-readable Kerberos keytab files are no longer
  accepted by default. Set `--allow_world_readable_credentials=true` to override
  this behavior. See
  link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1955[KUDU-1955] for additional
  details.

[[rn_1.5.0_deprecations]]
== Deprecations

* Support for Java 7 is deprecated as of Kudu 1.5.0 and may be removed in
  the next major release.

* Support for Spark 1 (kudu-spark_2.10) is deprecated as of Kudu 1.5.0 and may
  be removed in the next minor release.

[[rn_1.5.0_new_features]]
== New features

* Tablet servers are now optionally able to tolerate disk failures at
  startup. This feature is experimental; by default, Kudu will crash if it
  experiences a disk failure. When enabled, tablets with any data on the failed
  disk will not be opened and will be replicated as needed. To enable this, set
  the `--suicide_on_eio` flag to `false`. Additionally, there is a configurable
  tradeoff between a newly added tablet's tolerance to disk failures and its
  parallelization of I/O via the `--fs_target_data_dirs_per_tablet` flag.
  Tablets that are spread across fewer disks are less likely to be affected by a
  disk failure, at the cost of reduced parallelism. Note that the first
  configured data directory and the WAL directory cannot currently tolerate disk
  failures, and disk failures during run-time are still fatal.

* Kudu server web UIs have a new configuration dashboard (/config) which
  provides a high level summary of important security configuration values, such
  as whether RPC authentication is required, or web server HTTPS encryption is
  enabled. Other types of configuration will be added in future releases.

* The `kudu` command line tool has two new features: `kudu tablet move` and
  `kudu local_replica data_size`. The 'tablet move' tool moves a tablet replica
  from one tablet server to another, under the condition that the tablet is
  healthy. An operator can use this tool to rebalance tablet replicas between
  tablet servers. The 'local replica data size' tool summarizes the space usage
  of a tablet, breaking it down by type of file, column, and rowset.

* kudu-client-tools now supports exporting CSV files and importing
  Apache Parquet files. This feature is unstable and may change APIs and
  functionality in future releases.

* kudu-spark-tools now supports importing and exporting CSV, Apache Avro and
  Apache Parquet files. This feature is unstable and may change APIs and
  functionality in future releases.

== Optimizations and improvements

* The log block manager now performs disk synchronization in batches.
  This optimization can significantly reduce the time taken to copy tablet data
  from one server to another; in one case tablet copy time is reduced by 35%.
  It also improves the general performance of flushes and compactions.

* A new feature referred to as "tombstoned voting" is added to the Raft
  consensus subsystem to allow tablet replicas in the `TABLET_DATA_TOMBSTONED`
  state to vote in tablet leader elections. This feature increases Kudu's
  stability and availability by improving the likelihood that Kudu will be able
  to self-heal in more edge-case scenarios, such as when tablet copy operations
  fail. See link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-871[KUDU-871] for
  details.

* The tablet on-disk size metric has been made more accurate. Previously, the
  metric included only REDO deltas; it now counts all deltas. Additionally, the
  metric includes the size of bloomfiles, ad hoc indexes, and the tablet
  superblock. WAL segments and consensus metadata are still not counted. The
  latter is very small compared to the size of data, but the former may be
  significant depending on the workload (this will be resolved in a future
  release).

* The number of threads used by the Kudu tablet server has been further reduced.
  Previously, each follower tablet replica used a dedicated thread to detect
  leader tablet replica failures, and each leader replica used one dedicated
  thread per follower to send Raft heartbeats to that follower. The work
  performed by these dedicated threads has been reassigned to other threads.
  Other improvements were made to facilitate better thread sharing by tablets.
  For the purpose of capacity planning, expect the Kudu tablet server to create
  one thread for every five "cold" (i.e. those not servicing writes) tablets,
  and an additional three threads for every "hot" tablet. This will be further
  improved upon in future Kudu releases.

[[rn_1.5.0_fixed_issues]]
== Fixed Issues

* The Java Kudu client now automatically requests new authentication tokens
  after expiration. As a result, long-lived Java clients are now supported. See
  link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2013[KUDU-2013] for more
  details.

* Multiple Kerberos compatibility bugs have been fixed, including support
  for environments with disabled reverse DNS, FreeIPA compatibility, principal
  names including uppercase characters, and hosts without a FQDN.

* A bug in the binary prefix decoder which could cause a tablet server 'check'
  assertion crash has been fixed. The crash could only be triggered in very
  specific scenarios; see
  link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2085[KUDU-2085] for additional
  details.

[[rn_1.5.0_wire_compatibility]]
== Wire Protocol compatibility

Kudu 1.5.0 is wire-compatible with previous versions of Kudu:

* Kudu 1.5 clients may connect to servers running Kudu 1.0 or later. If the client uses
  features that are not available on the target server, an error will be returned.
* Rolling upgrade between Kudu 1.4 and Kudu 1.5 servers is believed to be possible
  though has not been sufficiently tested. Users are encouraged to shut down all nodes
  in the cluster, upgrade the software, and then restart the daemons on the new version.
* Kudu 1.0 clients may connect to servers running Kudu 1.5 with the exception of the
  below-mentioned restrictions regarding secure clusters.

The authentication features introduced in Kudu 1.3 place the following limitations
on wire compatibility between Kudu 1.5 and versions earlier than 1.3:

* If a Kudu 1.5 cluster is configured with authentication or encryption set to "required",
  clients older than Kudu 1.3 will be unable to connect.
* If a Kudu 1.5 cluster is configured with authentication and encryption set to "optional"
  or "disabled", older clients will still be able to connect.

[[rn_1.5.0_incompatible_changes]]
== Incompatible Changes in Kudu 1.5.0

[[rn_1.5.0_client_compatibility]]
=== Client Library Compatibility

* The Kudu 1.5 Java client library is API- and ABI-compatible with Kudu 1.4. Applications
  written against Kudu 1.4 will compile and run against the Kudu 1.5 client library and
  vice-versa, unless one of the following newly added APIs is used:

* The Kudu 1.5 {cpp} client is API- and ABI-forward-compatible with Kudu 1.4.
  Applications written and compiled against the Kudu 1.4 client library will run without
  modification against the Kudu 1.5 client library. Applications written and compiled
  against the Kudu 1.5 client library will run without modification against the Kudu 1.4
  client library.

* The Kudu 1.5 Python client is API-compatible with Kudu 1.4. Applications
  written against Kudu 1.4 will continue to run against the Kudu 1.5 client
  and vice-versa.
